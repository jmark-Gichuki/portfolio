                    <strong>Approach:</strong>
                    <p>
                        Loaded a pre-configured network topology in Packet Tracer and switched from Realtime to Simulation mode. Filtered events to view only HTTP traffic and generated web requests from a client to www.osi.local. Observed encapsulation and decapsulation processes across Layers 2‚Äì7 as data traveled between client and server.

                        In the second part, expanded the view to include DNS, ARP, and TCP events, tracking domain resolution, MAC address discovery, and the TCP three-way handshake. Examined each PDU‚Äôs layer details to understand how each protocol contributes to reliable communication and session management.

                        This lab reinforced the relationship between the OSI and TCP/IP models and how they cooperate during network transmission. Learned how encapsulation and decapsulation work, how DNS resolves names, how ARP maps hardware addresses, and how TCP establishes and terminates connections.

                <div class="lab-detail">
                    <strong>Problem:</strong>
                    <p>Capture and analyze both local and remote ICMP traffic using Wireshark to understand how packets are transmitted, addressed, and resolved across network layers.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="lab-detail">
                    <strong>Tools Used:</strong>
                    <p>Wireshark, Command Prompt, TCP/IP utilities (ping, ipconfig)</p>
                </div>
                <div class="lab-detail">
                    <strong>Approach:</strong>
                    <p>
                        Started by retrieving interface addresses using ipconfig /all to identify local network configurations. Initiated Wireshark and selected the active network interface to begin packet capture. Applied filters to isolate ICMP traffic and performed pings to both the local gateway (192.168.100.1) and remote hosts such as www.yahoo.com, www.cisco.com, and www.google.com.
                        
                        Analyzed captured packets to compare local versus remote traffic. Observed that local communication displayed both source and destination MAC addresses (e.g., PC-to-router), while remote traffic only displayed the default gateway‚Äôs MAC address. Examined how DNS resolved hostnames into IP addresses and how ARP resolved local device MACs before ICMP packets were sent.

                    <strong>Key Lessons:</strong>
                    <p>
                        This lab reinforced the difference between local (Layer 2) and remote (Layer 3) communication. When communicating within a LAN, devices use physical MAC addressing, while remote communication relies on the default gateway to forward packets. Learned how Wireshark can visualize packet flow, ARP resolution, and DNS lookups, enhancing network troubleshooting and analysis skills.

                    <p>Design, configure, and verify a basic network consisting of a router, switch, and two end devices using Cisco Packet Tracer.

                        Set up the network topology with a router, switch, and two PCs. Initialized and configured devices by assigning static IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to interfaces. Configured router interfaces (G0/0/0 and G0/0/1) for inter-subnet routing and set up the switch with VLAN interface and default gateway. Verified connectivity by successfully pinging between PCs through the router.

                        Used show commands (show ip route, show ipv6 route, and show interfaces) to confirm interface status, routing entries, and connectivity. Addressed common issues such as ‚Äúadministratively down‚Äù interfaces using the no shutdown command and corrected potential misconfigurations like duplicate IP assignments.

                        Accessed the ‚ÄúIntroduction to Network Traffic Analysis (Tier 0)‚Äù module on Hack The Box Academy. The lab covered both theoretical and practical aspects of analyzing network packets.

                        Initially reviewed the OSI and TCP/IP models to understand how data flows through different layers. Practiced using tcpdump to capture and filter network packets, applying switches such as -i, -v, -X, -r, and -w for various capture scenarios.

                        Then imported packet captures into Wireshark for detailed analysis. Applied display and capture filters to isolate protocols such as HTTP, DNS, ICMP, and SMB. Examined three-way handshakes, DNS resolutions, and HTTP requests to understand how communication occurs between clients and servers.

                        Additionally, explored Wireshark‚Äôs advanced features ‚Äî such as stream following, conversation statistics, and protocol breakdowns ‚Äî and practiced identifying suspicious activities and reconstructing files from captured traffic.
